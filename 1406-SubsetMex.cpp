/*
Given a set of integers (it can contain equal elements).

You have to split it into two subsets A and B (both of them can contain equal elements or be empty). You have to maximize the value of mex(A)+mex(B).

mex of a set denotes the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't exist in the set. For example:

mex({1,4,0,2,2,1})=3
mex({3,3,2,1,3,0,0})=4
mex(âˆ…)=0(mex for empty set)
